# SPlus Parser

The [Ostfalia SPlus lecture schedule](http://splus.ostfalia.de) is complicated to use, due to the lacking responsiveness especially on smartphones. However there are some really good and easy to use calendar programs/apps. This project serves as a bridge between SPlus and those programs.

## Setup

### General

Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

Copy and adjust `config-example.json` and run `npm start config.json`.
