# SPlus Parser

The [Ostfalia SPlus lecture schedule](http://splus.ostfalia.de) is complicated to use, due to the lacking responsiveness especially on smartphones. However there are some really good and easy to use calendar programs/apps. This project serves as a bridge between SPlus and those programs.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Copy `config-example.json`.

Start with `npm start ./config.json` or export `SPLUS_CONFIG=./config.json`. `./config-example.json` is the default configuration path.
